**REFERENCES**
I have recieved help from ChatGPT in making this project (as mentioned in the reflection report). 
The code to make memberships follow purchases made by the user was made with a lot of help from AI. 
Also setting up the database from back-end/utils/databaseInit.js, was made with help from AI. I wrote the code, but AI helped with the structure and debugging when I got stuck.

I got AI help for testing as well. I struggled and had to find the way. It wasn't straight forward, but together with AI I managed to finish it.
